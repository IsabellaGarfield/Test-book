| Table 1: Beach names present in data but not present in Figure 1, and the solutions for estimating their coordinates.   |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---: | :---: | ----- |
| **Beach names** | **\# observed** | **Issue** | **Solution** |
| NPG | 5 | Non-specific gully name | Coordinate values assigned to center NPG0 and NPG1 as these were the only named gullies at the time of resight  |
| NP2/3 | 2 | Non-specific beach name | Coordinate values assigned in between NP2 and NP3 |
| MBB | 11 | Non-specific beach name | Coordinate values assigned in between MBBL and MBBU |
| BBS | 18 | Non-specific beach name | Coordinate values assigned in between BBSL and BBSU |
| BM | 1 | Non-specific beach name | Coordinates values assigned in between following cluster of possible sites: BMB, BMNN, BMD, BMN, BMC, BMS |
| SBEU | 3 | Too specific | Additional coordinate values attributed to SBE, in ‘upper’ region |
| SBEL | 2 | Too specific | Additional coordinate values attributed to SBE, in ‘lower’ region |
| TSBE | 1 | Too specific | Additional coordinate values attributed to TSB, in ‘eastern’ region |
| NNPG3 | 1 | Typo  | Given same coordinate values as NPG3 |
| NPG2 | 1 | Beach name changed | Coordinates based off 2005 image |
| NPG3 | 1 | Beach name changed | Coordinates based off 2005 image |
| NPG2B | 1 | Beach name changed  (last resight in 2013\) | Coordinates based off 2005 image |
| APBN | 1 | Uninterpretable | Omitted |

| Table 2: Natal and pupping sites of known mom-pup pairs compared in the context of three broader regions of Año Nuevo colony; Northern (includes all beaches north of NPC), Central (includes beaches between BBNN and MBBU), and Southern (includes all beaches south/east of BMB, including inland regions). ‘*Beaches’* column identifies all beaches that make up each region. Beach names in bold are those observed as a natal and/or pupping site and are plotted in Figure 5\. *Italicized* beach names were entered as an observed natal and/or pupping site, but do not exist in Figure 1\. Names of beaches are ordered from northernmost to southernmost. For more information on italicized beaches, see Table 1\.    |  |  |  |  |  |
